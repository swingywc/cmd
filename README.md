# cmd
## All shell commands which help you code fast

#### 1. First git clone this project to somewhere inside your system
In my sample, my directory is `/cmd`. 

---
#### 2. Go to user directory `~`, add the following line into `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` if you have installed oh my zsh:
`export PATH="/path/to/the/cmd/directory:$PATH"`  

In my sample, the line will be `export PATH="/cmd:$PATH"`.

---
#### 3. If you want to use the custom command in existing terminal, run this command:  

`source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`.  

---

### Enjoy! Now you can use your own command in any directory! Time saved!
